Module 2 - Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

* * 

https://github.com/jazminearce/module2challenge



This project is to create a portfolio to display our work, give the reader some background about yourself, and how to get in contact with them.

## Header

The repo was made in GitHub and then after cloning it into my terminal, I created an index.html for structure and a style.css for styling.

I wanted to use a different font than the default ones in CSS so I linked the one I used:
 Font-
 https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lora:ital,wght@0,400..700;1,400..700&display=swap"

Then I created the heading for my name with the navigation bar next to it. I wanted to add icons next to each section heading for a better appearance, so I linked the ones I used here:
Icons-
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.min.css"

## About Me

The first section is the About Me section so I added in filler text with a photo of myself to the right, adding in some styling with border-radius and box shadowing

## Projects

The next section was for Projects, the first photo is an image of my module 1 challenge with a link that will take you to the 
GitHub website where my repo is.

The remainding 3 photos are some stock images I got from this website as a placeholder for future projects:

## Contact

The last section is the contact section, there are input sections for name, email, a message and a submit button.
