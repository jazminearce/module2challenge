       <h3>About Me:</h3>
       My name is Jazmine Arcé and I was born and raised in Miami, Fl. 
       I graduated from ASU in 2019 with a background in merchandsing, but I wanted to 
       give the healthcare field a try so I am now working as a dermatology medical assistant
       and surgical tech at a private practice in Southern California. I discovered tech in 
       healthcare and realized it better suits my lifestyle. I am currently enrolled in the coding
       bootcamp at the University of California Berkeley.
